# ggs-loadscreen by GGS.SX

A small script for using an external web server as a loading screen for fivem.

This script's purpose is to allow the use of loading screens made for Garry’s Mod to be usable for fivem. You could potentially use any loading screen that is compatible with [Garry’s Mod’s Loading_URL](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Loading_URL) but for fivem.

## But why?

In certain situations it can be faster to use a web service behind something like cloudflares CDN to display a loading screen rather than having content streamed to a user.

For a power user, using an external web service could allow you to display information specific to the user who is connecting before they load into the server like for example their character information, money, gang affiliation, ect. 

## Dependencies

- An external webserver or hosting provider
- A loading screen

## How to Setup?

Setup your website and make sure your loading screen works beforehand. 
Goto the index.html and change line 16 to the URL to your web server.
It's expected whoever is trying to use this script is a power user thus no support will be provided. 

## Where should I get a loading screen from?

[Gmodstore](https://www.gmodstore.com/market/browse?category=web&query=loading%20screen&sortby=new&page=1) has always offered premium loading screens but compatibility may vary. 

[Github](https://github.com) has a lot of open source loading screens for garry’s mod you could potentially use. 

Or if everything else fails, build something yourself. This script is provided as is.
